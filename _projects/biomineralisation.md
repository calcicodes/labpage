The formation and composition of marine biominerals is a key theme throughout our research.
Our work spans atom-scale observation of biomineral structures, the fundamentals of crystal growth processes, the biological mechanisms responsible for biomineral formation, to environment-scale patterns in mineral formation and dissolution.
We are interested in the fundamental processes that drive biomineral formation and dissolution, and how these processes are influenced by the environment.
