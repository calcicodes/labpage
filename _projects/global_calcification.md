A lot of our research focuses on the fine-scale processes that control the formation and dissolution of biomineral and inorganically formed calcium carbonated. We're also interested in how these processes scale up to the global level, and contribute to carbon cycling in the ocean.

So far, most of this work centres around coral reefs, which are one of the largest sites of calcium carbonate production in the ocean that is imminently threatened by climate change. We've looked into the processes that hold coral reefs together, and how these processes are changing in response to climate change, and we're also using machine learning approaches to try and predict which parts of the ocean corals will be able to live as global warming progresses.
