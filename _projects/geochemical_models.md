Geochemical models are a major tools in all of our research projects.
These models predict the trace element and isotopic composition of materials by integrating all the processes that may be involved in their formation.
We can then determine the importance of each of these candidate processes using inversion techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo, to assess the ability of these models to predict experimental results.
The resulting mechanistic understanding of mineral formation can then be used to predict and interpret geochemical patterns in natural systems.
