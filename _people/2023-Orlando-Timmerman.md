excerpt: Machine learning and coral reef survival.
---

Master of Research student using multi-modal machine learning to better understand where corals like to live in the past, present, and future.

Coral reef systems are incredibly complex systems of animal-plant symbiosis on which millions of people rely for food, protection from coastal storms, and income from tourism. Theyâ€™re also rather fussy, only surviving within certain envelopes of environmental conditions including temperature, aragonite saturation (a metric related to ocean acidification), and salinity. Climate change is gradually changing all of these conditions on a global scale. Understanding how reef systems will respond to these changes is essential to working out how to preserve them for future generations.

Machine learning is excellent at handling large datasets to learn complex relationships. There are exciting opportunities in multi-modal methods (cleverly combining data from lots of different sources) and super-resolution techniques (making data higher-resolution) which have yet to be developed for applications to coral reef science.

My Master of Research project aims to use machine learning to better understand the environmental conditions necessary for coral reefs to survive in order to predict current coral cover. My PhD next year will take this a step (or a few steps!) further to predict where reefs might be able to survive in future. I hope to guide conservation methods, for example establishing marine protected areas where they will be most effective. This will likely involve collaborative forays into machine learning methods to monitor and evaluate different conservation possibilities.
