## Research Interests

### Biomineralisation

The formation of calcium carbonate minerals by marine organisms is a central theme in my research.
I study how organisms manipulate chemical and physical processes to control crystal formation, examine the structure, mineralogy and composition of the complex 'biominerals' they produce, and study how these are preserved in the geological record.

### Geochemistry

I use the trace element and isotopic composition of marine biominerals as tracers of their formation mechanisms, and use these tracers to examine how biomineralisation processes respond to environmental changes.
Empirically established relationships between geochemical tracers and environmental conditions have been widely developed and interpreted as archives for past climate change, which have played a key role in developing our understanding of Earth's climate system.
However, our incomplete understanding of biomineralisation hinders our interpretation of these valuable records.
I work to advanced our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of biomineralisation and how they record the state of the climate system, and also how the act of biomineralisation modifies the state of the environment they form in.

### Ocean Carbon

The formation and dissolution of calcium carbonate biominerals plays a key role in the ocean carbon cycle, and the ability of the ocean to absorb anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>.
Uncertainties in our understanding of biomineral formation and dissolution mean that we cannot reliably predict the response of these key processes to future climate change, which is a significant area of uncertainty in future climate projections.
I conduct field and laboratory experiment to explore the dynamics of these processes in response to environmental stresses.
A major goal of my current research is to develop a quantitative mechanistic understanding of biomineral formation that can be used to understand how these processes will change in response to both future climate change, and the modification of seawater chemistry by ocean-based carbon capture and storage technologies.
