In our study, "Sulphate reduction and carbonate precipitation in a high-energy algal rim framework," we explored the fascinating processes happening in algal ridges at One Tree Island, Australia. These ridges are essential for protecting coral reefs from big waves. They're formed from reef debris, held together by crustose coralline algae (CCA). We wanted to understand how these structures stay strong by looking at how sulphate reduction and carbonate precipitation work together.

Algal ridges are crucial for coral reefs. They form elevated barriers on the windward sides of reefs, breaking up wave energy and protecting the calmer, more delicate areas. During storms, bits of coral get added to these ridges, making them taller and sturdier. The CCA on the surface precipitate high-magnesium calcite (HMC), which is vital for keeping the ridges intact.

We found that the inside of these ridges is mostly anoxic. This low-oxygen environment is perfect for the precipitation of carbonate minerals, driven by total alkalinity (TA) production from sulphate-reducing bacteria. We saw that hydrogen sulphide, TA, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) interacted in ways that showed anoxic respiration was key in producing alkalinity within the ridge. However, the formation of carbonate minerals reduced TA levels inside the ridges compared to the surrounding seawater. This also affected the pH of the water, suggesting that pH changes weren't just due to organic carbon breakdown.

Our methodology included sampling the surface and inside of the algal ridge framework. We collected samples from different spots, including isolated pools at low tide. We also conducted dome experiments to measure carbonate production and dissolution. These domes isolated parts of the ridge, allowing us to track changes in seawater TA, DIC, dissolved oxygen, and pH over time. The experiments showed that both photosynthesis and respiration influenced the carbonate dynamics within the ridges.

Algal ridges face significant threats from ocean acidification and climate change. HMC, the main form of carbonate in these ridges, is very soluble and vulnerable to dissolving as oceans become more acidic. This could undermine the stability and protective function of the ridges. Our study highlights the need for further research to understand the mechanisms of HMC precipitation and the broader implications for coral reef resilience.

In conclusion, our research sheds light on the complex biogeochemical processes within algal ridges, emphasizing the important role of sulphate reduction and carbonate precipitation in their formation and maintenance. These findings underscore the need to protect and understand these processes to sustain the structural integrity of algal ridges, which are essential for safeguarding coral reef ecosystems.
