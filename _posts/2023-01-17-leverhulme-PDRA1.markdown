I am seeking a postdoctoral researcher to join the multidisciplinary project “[Building Shells: Towards a Mechanistic Understanding of Biomineralisation]({% post_url 2022-12-14-leverhulme-project %})” funded by the Leverhulme Trust.

**Application Deadline:** Midnight (UTC) 1<sup>st</sup> April 2023. See [below](#applications) for more details.
{: .notice--warning}

## Project Context

This postdoctoral position is part of a large, cross-disciplinary project involving numerous international collaborators, three postdoctoral researchers and three PhD students over the next five years.
The project will bring together physiological, geochemical and computational approaches to advance our understanding of biomineralisation mechanisms.

The successful candidate will work alongside the PI, a [PhD student]({% post_url 2022-12-29-leverhulme-phd1 %}), and an international team of collaborators to grow marine calcifying organisms (corals, foraminifera, coccolithophores) under controlled conditions in laboratory and field settings, and measure the response of their physiology to these conditions (respirometry, calcification rates, transcriptomics).
The culture conditions will be designed to examine the pathways of ion transport and processes of crystal growth in biomineralisation, and will push organisms beyond conditions they experience in the wild.
The influence of these conditions on the rate of calcification and the activity of genes known to be related to ion transport pathways and mineralisation processes will be of particular interest.

As well as being of interest in their own right, these data will feed into a larger programme of geochemical measurements of biomineral composition, which together will inform computational modelling of biomineralisation processes.

## Applications

We are seeking a candidate with PhD-level experience in one or more of:

1. Culturing marine organisms;
2. Measuring the rates of respiration, photosynthesis and/or calcification of marine organisms at a fine scale;
3. Measuring and interpreting the transcriptome of marine organisms.

The research will involve lab- and field-based experiments, and use measurement equipment across the University (notably the Cambridge Advanced Imaging Centre and the Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science).
All necessary training will be provided, and the candidate will be mentored and supported in developing their career and research interests.
The logistical constraints of the research will require the successful candidate to base themselves in Cambridge.

The successful candidate would ideally be available to start on 1st July 2023, and the post will end on 30th June 2026 (3 years).

Please [get in touch](mailto:ob266@cam.ac.uk) to discuss the project in more detail, then submit an application via the [University of Cambridge Application Portal](https://www.jobs.cam.ac.uk/)

The deadline for applications is **midnight (UTC) on 1<sup>st</sup> April 2023**.
