I'm excited to announce the award of a [Leverhulme Trust Research Leadership Award](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/research-leadership-awards) for my project _{{ page.excerpt }}_.

This project will combine biology, geochemistry and computational modelling to develop a comprehensive mechanistic model of how marine calcifiers build their shells.
Eventually, we hope to use this model to predict the future of these important calcifiers under climate change, and improve our interpretation of geochemical palaeoclimate records.
To accomplish all this, I'll be joined by a cross-disciplinary team of three PostDocs and three PhD students over the next five years (2023-2028).
Together, we'll be growing calcifiers and tackling a diverse range of physiological (_respirometry, microsensors, confocal microscopy, transcriptomics_), geochemical (_trace elements, stable isotopes, laser ablation_) and computational (_mechanistic modelling, bayesian optimisation, Markov-chain Monte Carlo_) puzzles.

## Motivation

Calcium carbonate shells formed by marine organisms play critical roles in Earth’s past, present and future climate. Shells in the modern ocean are key determinants of how much carbon the ocean absorbs, and therefore the trajectory of atmospheric CO2 in the coming decades. Shells in ancient oceans record environmental conditions in their trace chemical and isotopic composition, providing invaluable ‘proxy’ archives that underpin our understanding of how climate responds to major perturbations. The state-of-the-art in both predicting future calcification and inferring past climate conditions relies upon empirical relationships being extrapolated beyond the conditions that they were established in. This approach receives substantial attention and investment, but is limited by a key knowledge gap: we do not know how these ‘biominerals’ form. Specifically, we lack a mechanistic understanding of biomineralisation that can quantitatively predict their formation rates and composition in known environmental conditions. Without this, we cannot assess the validity of our empirical extrapolations, or even determine the sources or magnitude of the uncertainties inherent in them. This places fundamental limits on our ability to predict the response of biominerals to future climate change, and infer past climatic conditions from their fossil composition.

A complete understanding of biomineralisation mechanisms has remained elusive for two key reasons. First, decades of focused research has been restricted to disciplinary silos. Biologists have focussed on the physiology and architecture of biomineralisation, mineralogists have advanced our understanding of precipitation processes, and geochemists have established empirical links between the environment and biomineral composition. Second, biomineralisation involves the confluence of these processes at the nanometre to sub-nanometre scale in delicate, transitory environments that remain beyond the limits of our observational techniques. I propose to surpass these disciplinary and technical boundaries by combining measurements of biomineral geochemistry, organism physiology and gene expression with Bayesian statistical techniques to derive a quantitative understanding of the underlying mechanisms of biomineralisation.

  <figcaption>**A schematic of biomineralisation and our modelling approach.** Calcifying organisms living in seawater (SW) produce calcium carbonate (CC) from the ‘calcifying fluid’ (CF), which is isolated from seawater by cellular material (CM). The formation of the biomineral is controlled by the intrinsic processes (shaded in grey) of biological ion transport (L, D, T) which determine the composition of the CF relative to seawater, and the rate (Prate) and mechanism (Pmech) of mineral formation that determine the composition of calcium carbonate produced from the CF. We can observe extrinsic variables such as seawater composition and temperature, and measure organism physiology and CC composition, but the intrinsic mechanisms of biomineralisation that link these observations remain elusive. I propose to create a quantitative mechanistic model that will parameterise the intrinsic biological and crystal growth processes that determine CF and CC composition, and determine the relative importance of these processes based on the response of CC composition, organism physiology and gene expression to carefully controlled extrinsic variables.</figcaption>
