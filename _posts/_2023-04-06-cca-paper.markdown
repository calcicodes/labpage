I recently worked with a group of international coral reef scientists to review the potential importance of crustose coralline algae (CCA) on coral reef calcification. 


CCA are a type of algae that form a hard, calcified skeleton on the surface of coral reefs. They are often overlooked in reef ecology, but they can contribute a lot to reef calcification. This is important because reefs are built from calcium carbonate, and the rate at which they build up is a key factor in determining their resilience to climate change.
